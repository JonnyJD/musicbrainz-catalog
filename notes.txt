Metadata still does not capture when and where the CD was purchased, when it was added, purchase price, etc. 

Should add extra.xml to capture this information. 

Should be easy to re-spin this concept for a DVD/BRD database. Amazon seems to have unique IDs for all their items, could use this ID. Amazon does offer some XML service, but not clear what it is. Might be able to parse their HTML instead.
